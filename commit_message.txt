feat: Implement real-time audit updates and fix bugs

This commit introduces several features and bug fixes to improve the functionality and user experience of the application.

Features:
- The audit completion percentage is now updated in real-time whenever a product is updated.
- The admin dashboard now displays the status of each audit.
- A "Save All" button has been added to the auditor dashboard to save all product changes at once.

Fixes:
- Fixed a 500 error on the `/api/audits/auditor/{auditor_id}` endpoint by eagerly loading the auditor relationship.
- Fixed a 403 error for the 'analista' role by pointing the user fetch to the correct `/api/users/auditors/` endpoint.
- Fixed a console accessibility warning related to the authentication modal.
